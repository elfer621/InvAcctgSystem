Confirm Dialog Preference
----------Solution--------------

    Start Firefox, and type about:config in the url bar. Firefox will show the preferences screen. Please take care not to make changes at random.
    Right click in the preferences area, and choose New > Integer from the popup menu.
    In the dialog box that now appears, enter dom.successive_dialog_time_limit, followed by the value 0 (zero). Press OK.
